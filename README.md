cocoafactory
============

This is our podspec repository for using with the awesome [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) Xcode dependency management system.  We use this repository for internal libraries, or importantly for libraries that are written by others that have no existing podspec.  In the latter case, we fork the code, write a [podspec](http://docs.cocoapods.org/specification.html) for it and put it in our repository so that we have access to it when writing a [Podfile](http://docs.cocoapods.org/podfile.html).

An excellent reference for internal podspec repositories is [here](http://pablin.org/2013/05/18/cocoapods-for-internal-libraries/)
